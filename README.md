# 2D Procedural / IK animation with prototype

## Made with
- Godot 4
- Souperior 2D Skeleton Modifications

## Content

Two versions for now :

- one full procedural animation, but the code is a bit of a mess and the walk can get easily blocked

- one with ik animation and step solver way more simpler and robust but not so much procedural animation
